This is a boiler system. Light turns up and down using a knob.

Main
If the valve was less the 25 then it would set the valve position to 0% which means the light will be off
if the valve is between 25 and 30 then it would have 25% light on. 
if the valve is between 30 and 40 then it would have 50% light on.
Anything greater than 40 the light will be fully on.
